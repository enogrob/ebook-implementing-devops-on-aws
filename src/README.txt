The practical examples found in this book involve the use of AWS resources, thus an AWS
account will be required.

The client-side tools used in the examples, such as the AWS CLI and Terraform, are
supported on most common operating systems (Linux/Windows/Mac OS).

This book is for system administrators and developers who manage AWS infrastructure
and environments and are planning to implement DevOps in their organizations. Those
aiming for the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer certification will also find this book useful.
Prior experience of operating and managing AWS environments is expected.
